# ASTROIDS


**Game Description**:
    The player controls a spaceships movement and shoots rocks floating through space. The
    player starts with 69 lifes, and if a rock hits the spaceship the player loses a life. If a player shoots
    a rock then the rocks break into four or two smaller asteroids depending on the rock shot, and the children rocks move faster than the parent rock.
    Every 40k score the level increases in hardness and rocks move faster   w/ possible 
    lorenz  movements through space. The smaller the rock the more points you get for shooting it down.
    Once the ship begins moving in a direction it will continue in that direction without player intervention unless the player applies
    thrust in a different direction.

   - left or "a" key: Turns the spaceship's nose to the left
   - right key or "d": Turns the spaceship's nose to the right
