# ASTROIDS


**Game Description**:
    The player controls a spaceships movement and shoots rocks floating through space. The
    player starts with 69 life's, and if a rock hits the spaceship the player loses a life. If a player shoots
    a rock, the the rocks break into four or two smaller asteroids depending on the rock shot that move faster than the original.
    Every 40k score the level increases in hardness and rocks move faster   w/ possible 
    lorenz  movements through space. The smaller the rock the more points you get for shooting it down.

    thrust in a different direction.
